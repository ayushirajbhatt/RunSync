# Project Overview

## Objective
This project focuses on harnessing biometric signals, including Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and Electrodermal Activity (EDA), captured through consumer-grade wearable technology like smartwatches and wristbands. Our goal is to use these non-invasive bio signals as inputs for an innovative music recommendation algorithm. This algorithm is specifically tailored for medium-distance runners, aiming to enhance their running experience and potentially boost their performance.

## Results
This BioSensory Computing project marks an essential first step towards a comprehensive bio-signal-based music recommendation system. Our deliverable is a Python notebook that adeptly processes biometric data from wearable devices to create customized playlists. This algorithm considers age, heart rate and target heart rate zones (using Karvonenâ€™s formula), and running pace to enhance the running experience. Check out our [Sample Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3AI3A2vA2FJ0zLmkQQpjqB) generated from real workout data.

## Model Design
Our model seamlessly integrates data extraction from Apple Health XML files with Spotify's streaming service to generate user-specific playlists. 

1. **Initialization**: Users input their age and Apple Health data. The model uses this to calculate maximum heart rate and heart rate zones via Karvonen's method.
2. **Data Aggregation**: We average heart rates over 3-minute intervals, aligning with the average song length.
3. **Heart Rate Zones**: The model assigns each interval to a heart rate zone, ranging from Zone 1 (50%-60% intensity) to Zone 5 (90%-100% intensity), to tailor the music tempo and style.
4. **Spotify Integration**: Parameters like valence, popularity, tempo, and genre are adjusted based on the heart rate zone to influence the user's heart rate indirectly.
5. **Playlist Generation**: Finally, the model creates a Spotify playlist, directly accessible to the user.

### Future Work
This version sets a foundation, with risk management strategies and an extensive feature list in our roadmap. Future enhancements will be guided by user feedback and further research, particularly in fine-tuning the Spotify API parameters for optimal playlist generation.
